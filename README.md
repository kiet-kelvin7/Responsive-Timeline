# Responsive-Timeline
A web timeline is the presentation of a chronological sequence of events along a drawn line that enables a viewer to understand temporal relationships quickly. In this project scope, I use the timeline to summarize my activities and societies started since I attended to Trinity Western University to the present. 

The technologies applied in this project include: Sublime (Text-editor), HTML5 and CSS3. The design is inspired by a Youtube channel called 'Online Tutorials'.
